# pokemon_types

A simple python program that utilizes pandas to scrape data from an online .JSON file that prompts the user for a type of pokemon and returns a list of pokemon with statistics that are strong & weak against that type. This program was inspired by myself as I always struggled to figure out which pokemon I should try to catch in video games to balance my pokemon line-up.
